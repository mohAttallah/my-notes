### Learned From Today's Lecture

---

The lecture I attended today was divided into 2 parts and covered topics such as wite **markdown** code **File control by Ubuntu** , **Git** and **Github**.

#### part 1 (Mark down Code)

We have learned how to write the markdown code and its importance in documenting projects.

#### part 2 (Ubuntu Command)

- Change a directory by command `cd`
- Create a New Folder by command `mkdir`
- Create a New File by Command `touch`

#### part 3 (Git and Github)

The main idea of Git and Github is to provide a version control system for software development and Provide Remote repo to backup file of project,it in the event that the device is damaged, and also to protect it from human errors .

##### Steps to Create remote Repo in Github and Push your File:

1. Create New Repo on Github
2. Add `Readme.md` file [Optional]
3. Clone Repo in your device by **ubntu**
4. for add New file to repo we use `Git add  .`
5. write commit to explain what do cahnge `git commit -m "write commit here"`
6. push to remote repo `git push origin main`.
